#### Description: Hello World.  This is my final project for CS50x, The REAL Legend of Zelda Remastered.  I decided to make a javascript game for my final project, because I had made a game in Scratch called the REAL Legend of Zelda.  Scratch has a lot of limitations, and I wanted to make an updated version of the game that broke through those limitations.  And I think I very much succeeded in that endeavour.  The game is made using HTML's canvas element and javascript for all of the logic and interactions.  The map was made in Tiled, and the sprites are free-use.  The music is from various Legend of Zelda games, and the game over music is from Final Fantasy 7.  The boundaries were also made in Tiled, and exported as data.  While I am proud of this project, there are some major optimizations that I would make to it.  One big optimization is currently I have the movement logic copy pasted 5 times, to account for the different boundaries on each level.  I tried to have just one movement function while working on the project, but due to my lack of understanding of functions and variables and the like, and also because of a number of bugs, I just ended up copy pasting the movement function multiple times.  I think I now have a better understanding of functions, and so I think this is an optimization that I would be able to do.  Though of course, it would be no small feat.  I was able to better optimize the movement for enemies though, so I am happy about that.  Anyways, below is a link to the original Scratch game, and the link to the github repository for the remastered game, for any who are interested.  Thank you for reading and this was CS50x.
